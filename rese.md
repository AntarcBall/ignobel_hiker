This is the ultimate Ig Nobel theme! It could be a clever and serious study that scientifically demonstrates “human inefficiency” using real mountaineering data.

The question “Who climbs the mountain most humanly?” perfectly captures the motto of the Ig Nobel Prize: “First make you laugh, then make you think.”

Here is a topic and analysis plan that develops this idea, reinforcing elements of computation and physics, and is worthy of the Ig Nobel Prize:

⛰️ Ig Nobel Prize in Bioengineering (or Peace):
“Finding the Most ‘Human’ Climber Using the Inefficiency Quotient (IQ_Hike)”

Topic:
“Analysis of GeoTracker data from a three-person climbing team: Measuring the ‘Inefficiency Quotient (IQ_Hike)’ by comparing the actual routes taken against the predicted most efficient route using Gradient Descent. Thus, determining who climbed the most irrationally and most ‘humanly’.”

The main Ig Nobel idea:
The least efficient climber is the most ‘human’ winner.

The ‘Inefficiency Calculator’ represents the triumph of humanity over the inhuman efficiency of artificial intelligence.

Comparison and analysis plan:

Stage 1: Efficiency benchmark (Algorithm: Optimal Path_GD)

Element Content (Gradient descent) Physics/math. analysis
Cost function C(x) Cost = (distance) + β (slope) Path in 3D terrain $\mathbf{x}=(x, y, h)$, ∇C minimized

Most efficient path (Path_GD) Fastest and steepest ascent path according to GeoTracker data Path with least work $W_{\min}$

Stage 2: Collect data for each climber

Climber Actual path (Path_Hiker,i) Physics/math. analysis
Climber i GeoTracker: time, 3D coordinates, speed, rest time Actual work done $W_i$ and path length $L_i$

Stage 3: Calculation of the inefficiency coefficient (IQ_Hike)

The inefficiency calculator combines several indices to give the final value $\text{IQ}_{\text{Hike}}$:

Energy inefficiency index (IQ_E):
Formula: $IQ_E = \frac{W_i - W_{\min}}{W_{\min}}$
Meaning: how much more energy was spent compared to the least energy path.

Path irrationality index (IQ_L):
Formula: $IQ_L = \frac{L_i - L_{GD}}{L_{GD}}$
Meaning: the distance traveled in excess of the most efficient path (e.g., "taking a detour to see the view").

Inefficiency Index of Joy Acceleration (IQ_A):
Formula: The variance of the absolute values ​​of acceleration.
Meaning: It reflects the nonlinear, emotional movements of a person, which suddenly stop and accelerate again.

Final Inefficiency Coefficient:
$IQ_{\text{Hike}} = (IQ_E \times w_E) + (IQ_L \times w_L) + (IQ_A \times w_A)$

The climber with the highest $\text{IQ}_{\text{Hike}}$ value will be declared the "most human climber"!

This study finally scientifically proves that "the most efficient climb is the most boring climb." In the era of artificial intelligence efficiency, it shows the value of human inefficiency and could be a worthy candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize.
